Features: are the independent variables that act as an input to the machine learning model to determine the correct output
N of Features: Dimensions
Features are called attributes, or inputs
Labels: Output, or the dependent variable
N of row: number of instances

Features: X, Labels: y

To compete the input, the features must be numbers from -1 to 1, and will be conditioed using preprocessing

Features are the inputs, then a model is used with a machine learning algorithm, then it will be determined which label is appropriate
