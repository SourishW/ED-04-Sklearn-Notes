This is a classifying and regression model
It seperates the data points into regions

Any datapoints in each region will have the appropriate labels

The axis represent the features, and we can have as many features/dimensions as we want

How Nearest neibhors work: given the number of neighbors, if a majority of the n nearest numbers have a specific label relative to a specific location, then that location will be classified as where those features lie

A greater value is better when there is a large number of instances/data

If there is a big dataset, we can use a higher k
If there is a smaller dataset, we use a smaller k

It is advised to use an odd number k.

Weights can be uniform, or can be weighted by distance (closer data points are given more importance). This makes it more sensitive
