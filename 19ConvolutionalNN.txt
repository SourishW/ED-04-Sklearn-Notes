Convolutional neural network:

There is a convolutional layer in between, which is a normal layer in between, except the layer adds a filter, which makes a difference. It allows the layer to detect patterns. 

They way it does it, is it does a dot product with another matrix that it has, moving to the right every time. 

The convolutional layer will apply filters to various parts of the image to detect patterns and differences with the images
