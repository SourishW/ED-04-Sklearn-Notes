Consider a set of data, where there is a linear regression between the points, and the points are 2D

The regression line would have an r^2 value that indicates how accurate the line represents the data points

Its a simple y = mx +b line

however, if there are two sub trends, the linear regression line would draw straight through them, not caring about the difference in trends

Whereas, logistic regression would return a sigmoid function that is like a titration curve, and passes through both. It looks like an S, and it is y = 1 / (1 + e^-x)
